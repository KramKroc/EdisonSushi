# EdisonSushi - Basic
The Sushi Card are designed to be used with the **Edison** robot within a CoderDojo session. The idea is that each card is practice-led so information is gained from *doing* rather than just *reading* the text on the cards :D

The cards are relatively short and all 6 can hopefully be tackled in  90 minute session (but that's yet to be proven!). These cards are focused on learning about the Edison, how to program it and also how to get it moving and turning. More advanced cards on reacting to external events will follow later.

To use, simply download this project as a zip (or even check iut out as a git project) by clicking on the link on the *Download ZIP* button on the right of the page. Then print out the PDFs under the **ActivitySheets** and **Worksheets** folders. You'll notice that each card or activity sheet will side1 and a side2. The idea is to print the pages out and laminate the side1 and side2 pairs together for a card. Simple!

If you'd like to modify, adapt or use the content then go to the **Source** folder to find the SVG's. They were create using InkScape which is free and can be used with iOS, Linux and Windows. More details on this can be found on the [Sushi site of CoderDojo](http://kata.coderdojo.com/wiki/Sushi). Take a look at the license information below. 

## Thank You

A massive thanks you to the **Edison folks** and **Michelle Miller** whose material this is entirely based on. The only addition here is to format it in the Coderdojo Sushi format so that it would have a familiar look and feel to the other Sushi cards that Dojo's may be using.
